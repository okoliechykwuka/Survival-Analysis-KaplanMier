# Survival-Analysis-KaplanMier


The Kaplan–Meier estimator also known as the product limit estimator, is a non-parametric statistic used to estimate the survival function from lifetime data. In medical research, it is often used to measure the fraction of patients living for a certain amount of time after treatment. In other fields, Kaplan–Meier estimators may be used to measure the length of time people remain unemployed after a job loss,[3] the time-to-failure of machine parts, or how long fleshy fruits remain on plants before they are removed by frugivores.


In the above analysis, we want to estimate the survival probabilities for patients which can help medical researchers to focus on factors that leads to poor survival rates for patients.
